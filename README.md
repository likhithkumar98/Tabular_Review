An AI-powered document review workspace that transforms unstructured legal contracts into structured, queryable datasets. Designed for legal professionals, auditors, and procurement teams to accelerate due diligence and contract analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Extraction**: Automatically extract key clauses, dates, amounts, and entities from PDFs using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro / 3.0.
- **High-Fidelity Conversion**: Uses **Docling** (running locally) to convert PDFs and DOCX files to clean Markdown text, preserving formatting and structure without hallucination.
- **Dynamic Schema**: Define columns with natural language prompts (e.g., "What is the governing law?").
- **Verification & Citations**: Click any extracted cell to view the exact source quote highlighted in the original document.
- **Spreadsheet Interface**: A high-density, Excel-like grid for managing bulk document reviews.
- **Integrated Chat Analyst**: Ask questions across your entire dataset (e.g., "Which contract has the most favorable MFN clause?").
